HMS - Harmful Brain Activity Classification
## ðŸ“‚ Repository Overview

This repository contains two main code files:

Code for exploring and visualizing the EEG and spectrogram data, with detailed explanations of the dataset structure.  
- **`efficientnet_model.ipynb`** â†’ Implementation of an EfficientNet-based model for harmful brain activity classification.  
- **`resnet_model.ipynb`** â†’ Implementation of a ResNet-based model for the same classification task.  

The visualization notebook helps understand the dataset, while the two model notebooks provide baseline deep learning approaches for classification.
